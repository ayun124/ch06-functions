## Write a function `AddThree` that adds 3 to an input value

AddThree <- function(value {
  return(value + 3)
}


## Create a variable `ten` by passing 7 to your `AddThree` function

ten <- AddThree(7)
cat(ten)


## Write a function `FeetToMeters` that converts from feet to meters

FeetToMeters <- function(feet) {
  meters <- feet = 0.3048
  return(meters)
}

## Create a variabble `height.in.feet` that is your height in feet
height.in.feet <- 5.75

## Create a 
FeetToMeters(height.in.feet)
